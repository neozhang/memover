This repo is for the final project of GSBGID 517 - AI & Power.

The requirements for the final project are as follows:

Final Project

You need to form a group of 3 students. Your group will build something that helps us understand and/or intervene on power and influence in AI.

This can take many forms - e.g., a tool that helps detect sycophancy, a short AI-made video that teaches people how to triangulate across models, or a business/policy strategy that changes who holds power in the AI stack.

What you must include

- Use case: Pick one specific context where people or organizations use AI (who is the user, what are they doing, why it matters).
- Power / influence problem: Identify the influence mechanism you’re targeting (e.g., the organizing layer, sycophancy, framing, defaults, personalization, distribution lock-in, etc.).
- Intervention: Build an artifact (tool, workflow, content, or strategy) that helps a user, entrepreneur, leader, journalist, policymaker, or other relevant actor detect and/or reduce that influence.

Deliverables

- Your artifact/prototype (tool, workflow, content, or strategy doc)
- 8-10 slide deck

What your slides should contain (8-10 slides)

1. Title + team
2. The use case (who/when/why it matters)
3. The power/influence problem
4. Power map: who influences whom + where the leverage/choke point is
5. Why current approaches aren’t enough
6. Your intervention: what you built + how it changes outcomes
7. Walkthrough/demo of an artifact
8. “Before -> after” examples (show the difference)
9. Limits/risks (how it could fail or backfire)

Deadline: midnight on 2/2
